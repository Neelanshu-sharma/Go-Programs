/*The break statement in Go programming language has the following two usages âˆ’

When a break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.

It can be used to terminate a case in a switch statement.

If you are using nested loops, the break statement will stop the execution of the innermost loop and start executing the next line of code after the block.*/
